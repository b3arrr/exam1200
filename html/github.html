                    <h3>What are Git and GitHub?</h3>
                    <!--Each article has a subheader of <h2> leaving <h1> to be the title of the page, but still allowing to separate topics-->
                    <p>
                        Are Git and GitHub the same? No, because: Git is a version control system (VCS), that “…tracks changes to files over a period of time.”(Kerr, 2024)
                        While GitHub is “…a cloud-based platform where you can store share, and work together with others to write code.”(GitHub Docs, n.d.-b)
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Put simply, Git is a tool for version control that tracks every change made in the file or code,
                        and GitHub is a platform that is based on the technology that Git offers and “…lets you manage 
                        Git repositories”(Devmountain, n.d.) so it’s possible to collaborate and share.

                    <h3>What are the benefits of collaborating using Git and GitHub? </h3>
                    <p>Many advantages are worth mentioning, but here are some of them: </p>
                    <ul>
                        <!--Using <strong> tag to semanticly emphazise the different topic of each list item-->
                        <li>
                            <strong>Makes it possible to collaborate as a team on one file.</strong>
                            Instead of creating a new copy of the file for each iteration, you can have one main file because Git tracks all the changes done over time. 
                            By doing this, the developer can see(GitHub Docs, n.d.-a):
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>View the entire timeline.</strong> 
                            Git allows developers to “…see the entire timeline of their changes, decisions, and progression of any project in one place.”(GitHub Docs, n.d.-a) 
                            This makes the collaboration transparent and reproducible(Coursera, 2023). 
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Real-time collaboration.</strong> 
                            It breaks down the communication barriers and makes it possible to have different working methods within the team 
                            (synchronously and physically/digitally, or/and asynchronously)(Coursera, 2023; GitHub Docs, n.d.-a). 
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Create branches. </strong> 
                            By creating branches from the main copy of files, developers can work without fearing that the changes will impact the work of the rest of the team. 
                            When the work is ready, it can be integrated into the main file.(GitHub Docs, n.d.-b)
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Restore earlier versions. </strong> 
                            Should something happen, e.g. that the integrated code affects the program negatively, 
                            developers can easily revert to previous versions if necessary.(Coursera, 2023)
