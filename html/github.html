                    <p>
                        We encountered a few challenges when we first set up the
                        GitHub repository, particularly with team members being
                        unable to perform a git pull. This caused some delays as
                        everyone was unable to retrieve the latest updates from
                        the repository. Fortunately, during one of our lab
                        sessions, the teaching assistants (TAs) were able to
                        assist us. They walked us through resolving the issue by
                        using GitHub Desktop, which simplified the process and
                        ensured that everyone could successfully pull the latest
                        changes.

                            <strong>Version Control:</strong> Git tracks every
                            change made to the code, allowing teams to easily
                            revert to previous versions if necessary.

                            members can work on different branches without
                            conflicts, making collaboration efficient.

                        <li>
                            <strong>History Tracking:</strong> All commits are
                            logged with details about the changes, helping track
                            the evolution of the project.

                        <li>
                            <strong>Collaboration:</strong> Git enables seamless
                            collaboration by allowing code reviews, discussions,
                            and merging of changes from different contributors.

                            <strong>Backup and Safety:</strong> Git repositories
                            act as a backup for your project, reducing the risk
                            of losing important code changes.
